These unique securities act very differently than fixed- rate bonds, and their volatility can change over time, depending on the level of interest rates. For non-U.S. domiciled securities, these are often referred to as inflation-linked bonds or linkers. In Canada these are termed real return bund and in Britain the inflation-linked Gilt.

    "description": "Agency-backed collateralized mortgage obligations are backed by pools of mortgage pass-throughs (or a pool of mortgage loans) whose underlying cash flows are guaranteed by a government agency such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac. They are structured into several classes of securities (known as tranches) with varying maturities and rules for the distribution of principal and interest payments from the underlying collateral. Each tranche typically has a different degree of prepayment and interest-rate risk. Generally the goal is to create a series of tranches that can offer greater stability or predictability of cash flows over a wide range of prepayment speeds. Investors in search of those traits are typically willing to accept lower yields in exchange, while other tranches in the structure normally offer higher yields as compensation for taking on the risks eliminated from the more predictable tranches. There are several ways to structure CMOs, resulting in a variety of tranche names that are not always present in each CMO. There are other factors that may make an individual tranche of an individual CMO act differently than others with similar names, but under normal conditions those labeled as sequentials, PACs, and VADMs, for example, are considered relatively safe or stable, while others such as IOs, POs, inverse floaters, and Z bonds are normally expected to offer significantly higher potential returns and volatility."

Because they lack a third-party guarantee, protection in the case of non-agency RMBS is generally provided through the creation of subordinate securities. These are first in line to offer credit protection to the senior-most AAA rated classes and are accordingly priced at lower prices relative to AAAs, reflecting their higher exposure to credit risk."
